              <h2>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</h2>
              
              <!-- Description -->
              <p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that significantly impacts the ability to speak. As ALS advances, patients typically experience a gradual decline in their speech capabilities, which can be attributed to the deterioration of specific areas in the brain and nervous system.</p>
              
              <!-- Areas of the Brain Affected -->
              <h3>Areas of the Brain Affected:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Motor Cortex:</strong> The primary area affected in ALS is the motor cortex, which is responsible for voluntary muscle movements, including those involved in speech production.</li>
                <li><strong>Brainstem:</strong> The brainstem houses the nuclei of cranial nerves that control the muscles used in speaking, swallowing, and breathing. Degeneration in this area leads to bulbar symptoms, which are commonly associated with speech impairment in ALS.</li>
                <li><strong>Spinal Cord:</strong> The spinal cord's upper and lower motor neurons also degenerate in ALS, affecting the neural pathways that transmit signals from the brain to the muscles.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <!-- Phases of Losing the Ability to Talk -->
              <h3>Phases of Losing the Ability to Talk:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Phase:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mild Dysarthria:</strong> In the initial stages, patients might notice mild speech changes, such as slurring of words or a slight change in voice pitch and tone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Speech may become tiring, especially after prolonged conversations, and there may be occasional choking or difficulty swallowing.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Intermediate Phase:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pronunciation Difficulties:</strong> As the disease progresses, patients find it increasingly challenging to articulate words clearly. Speech becomes slower and more effortful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Intelligibility:</strong> The ability to form consonants and vowels is impaired, making it harder for others to understand the patient.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Phase:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Severe Dysarthria:</strong> In advanced stages, speech intelligibility is severely compromised. Patients may only be able to produce short, fragmented sentences or individual words.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anarthria:</strong> Eventually, patients may lose the ability to speak entirely. At this stage, alternative communication methods, such as speech-generating devices or eye-tracking systems, become essential.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
          
              <!-- Conclusion -->
              <p>The progression of speech impairment in ALS varies among individuals, but the general trend is a gradual decline in speech capabilities as motor neurons continue to degenerate. Addressing speech impairment in ALS requires a multidisciplinary approach, including speech therapy, assistive technologies, and supportive care to help patients maintain communication and quality of life for as long as possible.</p>
